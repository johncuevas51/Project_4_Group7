#Loan Approval Prediction Using Machine-Learning

Banks are making major part of profits through loans. Though lot of people are applying for loans. It’s hard to select the genuine applicant, who will repay the loan. While doing the process manually, lot of misconception may happen to select the genuine applicant.

Therefore, developing loan prediction system using machine learning, so the system automatically selects the eligible candidates. This is helpful to both bank staff and applicant. The time period for the sanction of loan will be drastically reduced. In this project we are predicting the loan data by using some machine learning algorithms.
